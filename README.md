# 🌫️ AQI Forecasting System using LSTM

This project is an end-to-end **Air Quality Index (AQI) forecasting system** built using **Deep Learning (LSTM)**, deployed as a **Streamlit web application**, and complemented with **Power BI** dashboards for comparative analysis.

The system predicts the **next 7 days AQI** for multiple Indian cities and provides interactive visualizations, AQI category interpretation, and downloadable forecast reports.
